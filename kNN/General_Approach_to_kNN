General approach to kNN
-----------------------
1. Collect: Any method.
2. Prepare: Numeric values are needed for a distance calculation. A structured data format is best.
3. Analyze: Any method.
4. Train: Does not apply to the kNN algorithm.
5. Test: Calculate the error rate.
6. Use: This application needs to get some input data and output structured numeric values.
   Next, the application runs the kNN algorithm on this input data and determines which class
   the input data belongs to. The application then takes some action on the calculated class.
